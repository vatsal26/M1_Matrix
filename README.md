| Feature Id | Feature |
| -----------|---------|
|F_01| Options to select matrix operation|
|F_02| Operations on two matrices such as addition, subtraction and multiplication are included|
|F_03| Single matrix operations such as determinant, transpose and inverse of a matrix |
|F_04| Separate function for each operation |
|F_05| A structure has been implemented for storing the matrices|
|F_06| Dynamic memory allocation and deallocation has been implemented for the matrices|
|F_07|  There is no upper limit for the size of the matrix|

## Challenges Faced and How Was It Overcome

| No. | Challenge | Solution
|-----|-----------|--------
|1. | Dynamic memory allocation of 2D arrays created segmentation faults| running the code in GDB helped find the line where the program crashes
|2. | Program crashes | Writing clean code with allocating and deallocating memory at all functions as per requirement|
|3. | Logical errors faced while designing matrix operations| Referred some articles to revise matrix basics and operations on 2D arrays
|4. | Unit testing on dynamic 2D array outputs| Created enumerated variables to be returned by those functions if the specified operation executes successfully
