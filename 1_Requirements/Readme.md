# Requirements
## Introduction
  * Mathematical  operations are part of our daily lives. Every day we will be engaging with different types of calculations around us. Matrices is a mathematical organization where numbers are arranged in rows and columns. Most existing applications have a matric in real life.The main application is in the field of software such as the development of algorithms such as path finder algorithms, image processing algorithms and much more.
  * This project introduces several basic matrix operations that allow the user to choose what to do with the matrix. Then a matrix with size is introduced. Only square matrices are considered in the project.
## Research

### Objective
This project focuses on the matrix operation of the square matrix. Added and subtracts the tasks performed in a pair of square matrices and adds multiplication and multiplication. The work performed in a single square matrix has transmission, decision and reversal.

### Benefits

Users who work on a laptop or desktop computer to work with matrix calculations will find this application handy. A human can find the output of a matrix that is not larger than 3 X 3, i.e. 3 rows and 3 columns. Attempting to solve a matrix for more than 3 dimensions is time consuming and additional time is required to check the correctness of the solution. Therefore, this tool can be used to cross-check the matrix operation performed.


## Cost and Features

 * The cost of implementing projects related to matrix calculations is minimized anything. However, the expansion of the matrix application for a variety of art domains such as machine learning, image processing, encryption, and route search algorithms will confirm that research and development will confirm. This program is useful for the required settlement for the matrix.
 
 ### Some of The features of the project

 * This program uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate memory for a matrix, that is, a two-dimensional array. A structure for storing input matrices has been implemented. Users can select an action to perform by pressing a number on the keyboard. The value of each number, i.e. the action it performs, is displayed on the screen while the program is running.


## Defining Our System
* The system is typically displayed as a blackbox, allowing one number of inputs. Then, the number of numbers is performed to perform the appropriate function. The user is then asked to enter the size of the matrix. You will then be prompted to enter the Matrix Element. The input is stored in a 2D array that is dynamically noticeable and sent to the appropriate function. The output is then printed on the screen. The entire process is located in the cycle until the user presses the keys from the program.
